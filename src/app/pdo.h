/**
 * @brief This function is called by the PD stack to allow the application
 * logic to evaluate the Source Capabilities received from the port partner
 * and generate the desired request. The request object is expected to be
 * passed back to the stack through the app_resp_handler() callback.
 *
 * The default implementation of this function matches each of the received
 * source PDOs against the active sink capabilities; and then selects the
 * source PDO that can deliver the maximum power to the system as a sink.
 *
 * @param port Port index the function is performed for.
 * @param srcCap Pointer to PD packet which contains source capabilities.
 * @param app_resp_handler Application handler callback function.
 *
 * @return None
